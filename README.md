# Spotify Clone

Spotify Clone is a front-end replica of the Spotify web application interface. It provides a sleek, responsive, and interactive user experience where users can:

- Browse a music library or playlist

- View album art and track details

- Play, pause, skip tracks, and control volume

- See a bottom “Now Playing” bar / playback controls

- Enjoy modern UI transitions and layout styling
  

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on replicating the look and feel of Spotify’s UI and basic playback behavior. It’s a great clone to showcase front-end skills in user interface, media control logic, and responsive design.
